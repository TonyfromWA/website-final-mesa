<center><h1 id="Holidayss">Holidays</h1>
  <p>Holidays brighten the whole year, it's like a blank piece of paper, but then you start decorating it, turning it from a sad lonely paper, to a colorful and bright place.</p>
<h3 id ="christmas">Christmas</h3></center>
<p>The experience I get for christmas is the best feeling in the world, it's the season to stay inside, watch tv, drin hot cocoa
and relax. it's also the snow, I love snow, some years we don't get snow, but when I do, I'm really happy. Snow is like more moldable
sand, that doesn't get everywhere. Let's talk about the main part, the presents, when your a kid, you get spoiled with presents and it
is one of the best feelings ever. I'm still a kid, so I don't know how adults feel.</p>
<center><h3 id="Holloween">Holloween</h3></center>
<p>Holloween is mid,it's where you dress up, for one night to ask for candy, for adults this holiday must suck, but kids like
it, I don't like Holloween as much as christmas, but it's still a good holiday.</p>
<center><h3 id="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</h3></center>
<p>Thanksgiving is great, you eat a turkey and spend time with your family, s tier. In my family, we hold thanksgiving in my uncles house, but my parents are the one making the food, so we arrive at there house first, but the funny part, is we arrive at the house before my uncle does. </p>
<center><h3 id="Mybirthday"> Birthday</h3></center>
<p>My birthday. I share my birthday with two other people, my math teacher, and my friend. Both of them are better at 
  "birthdaying than me. but still, I get presents so I'm happy.</p>
<center><h3 id="badHolidays">other holidays.</h3></center>
<p> These are the holidays I didn't mention. Valintines day, this day makes me feel sad, also this days only use, is 
making the whole school day, anything but learning. St. Patricks day, I don't know any leprecons so I don't know any 
thing about this. New Years, I like it, the start of something new, and a great way to end off winter break. July 4th, 
the start of my favorite country, I like the fireworks and looking at history movies, that's it. Easter is great, one of 
best celebration, celebrating the birth of the easter bunny, on this day, the sun is shining and everything is as bright 
as a cartoon. Black Friday, 12 times better than valentines day, and st. Patricks day.</p>
