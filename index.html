        <h3 id="video games"> Video games </h3>
        <p>
          Video games are a unique form of entertainment that transcends traditional storytelling, immersing players in dynamic 
          worlds where they can explore, create, and interact in ways that are truly special. Unlike passive media, games invite 
          players to become active participants, allowing them to shape narratives and influence outcomes through their choices 
          and actions. This interactive nature fosters a sense of agency and connection, whether it's forming bonds with in-game 
          characters or collaborating with friends online. Moreover, video games can serve as powerful tools for learning, promoting 
          critical thinking, problem-solving, and even emotional resilience. As technology continues to evolve, the possibilities 
          for innovation within gaming are boundless, making it a continually exciting medium that resonates with diverse audiences 
          across the globe.

        <h3 id="Aiden">Aiden</h3>
        <p>
          Aiden was a small boy with big, soulful eyes that seemed to carry the weight of the world. At just eight years old,
          he often found himself lost in a whirlwind of emotions, struggling to make sense of the chaos around him. The laughter
          of other children echoed in the playground, but Aiden preferred the quiet corners where he could escape the noise. 
          His home, filled with shadows and uncertainty, offered little comfort, and he often clutched a worn-out stuffed bear
          for solace. Despite his struggles, there was a spark of resilience in Aiden, a flicker of hope that whispered to him 
          during the darkest nights, urging him to believe that brighter days were just around the corner.</p>
        <h3 id="Mydogs">My dogs</h3>
        <p>My three dogs, known as boy cho (3 years old), girl cho (3 years old), and fei fei (8-9 years old). The cho cho 
          (Girl cho and boy cho) are toy red poodle and Fei Fei is a chuhuahua, he's a small dog, but is kind for a chihua hua. 
          All three of my dogs are overweight, especially boy Cho, at 30 pounds when he's suppose to be 25. I love all my dogs, 
          my favorite be fei fei.</p>
