<p>   On a regular day, I wake up and shower, go to my grandpas house with my mom to eat breakfest, and then we finally arrive at school. the time I get to school <br>
    varies from being on time, to being 5 minutes early, to 5 minutes late. 
      The first class I go to is math, I like math, in math, you figure stuff out. Unlike History or science, in History and science you need to remember everything. <br>Another reason I like Math is because the teacher, Mrs.G is really nice and one of my fsavorite teachers<br>
  
      My next class is History, MID. History is generic, whatever you expierience in your History is here, the excact same. Than Soar, Soar is good, It's only 15 minutes, <br>
    it's like break time, but we talk instead.
      Than science, I hate Science, I don't understand it at all, and at the end of science, I forget everything I learn. <br>
    We had a test last week, and I got the lowest grade I ever got on a middleschool test, 73%, you might say it's not a big deal, it was for me, to be honest, I still<br>
    don't know what the test means. 
      Next is Webdesign thanks to webdesign is why I'm making this. 
      After is Lunch, everyone has the same perspective on lunch as me, you hang out with your frieds to talk about class and eat food.     
      Aftr is English, screw English, It'sway to hard, not hard like I don't get it, hard as in it's hard to stay awake,, I wanted to sleep so bad during this, instea of counting sheep, <br>write an essay to sleep instead. Something bad about it is that, when you're writing an essay about a ,<br>how are you supose to remember and put dialoge, most of the time I just lie, I don't know what my mom said three months ago, I don't remember even what she said today.
      After English is Bible, it's chill, we learn about the Bible and chill, it's relaxing. After that is Coding, It's hard. At the end of the day, I feel like I wasted my time<br>
    I would have rather played video games than learn skills that I'll never use again(science).
